Question 1: (compulsory)
Create a file upload feature in Flutter that accepts any image or video files, less than 10 MB and upload the file to the firebase storage.
Add some some interactions or animations like upload progress and file upload status Add a preview of the file that has been uploaded.
Place appropriate validations and error messages wherever required.

In this question, we have to upload a image or a video with a proper validation and UI interface inlcuding alert messages for large file size. After upload a videos/images, it is again downloading from the firebase storage and video can be play.

Question 2:
Write a simple application using a recursive function that accepts a value (integer) and returns the fibonacci value at that position in the series. The application should be performant at scale to handle larger numbers without slowing down exponentially.

In this question, we have used recursive function to find factorial of the number. For larger number, facotrial value will be too large so we are showing infinity sign in that place.

Question 3:
A string is balanced if it consists of exactly two different characters and both of those characters appear exactly the same number of times. For example: "aabbab" is balanced (both 'a' and 'b' occur three times) but "aabba" is not balanced ('a' occurs three times, 'b' occurs two times). String "aabbcc" is also not balanced (it contains three different letters). A substring of string S is a string that consists of consecutive letters in S. For example: "ompu" is a substring of "computer" but "cmptr" is not. Write a function solution called getBalancedSubstrings (List<String> S) that, given a string S, returns an array of the longest balanced substring of S.
Examples: 1. Given S = "cabbacc", the function should return ["abba"] because it is the longest balanced substring.

In this question, we are checking whether the input string is balanced or not.
